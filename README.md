# hi, i’m kira 👋

front-end engineer who builds things with React, TypeScript, and an unreasonable amount of coffee

currently creating value at Sombra, shipping clean, accessible, sometimes even bug-free code

---

### tech that makes me happy
`React` • `TypeScript` • `Next.js` • `GraphQL` • `Vite`

---

### ask me about
- just how nerdy can i be about making coffee
- board games
- which code editor i use (spoiler: it's neovim!)
- what is my favourite html element (it's `<marquee>`! don't worry, i _always_ make it accessible for users with `prefers-reduced-motion`)
